# My Personal Site

This is my static site that is hosted on [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) (using S3 and Cloudfront services).

This site is based on the [Much-Worse jekyll theme](https://github.com/gchauras/much-worse-jekyll-theme). The theme is available under [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Let's test! Will it work?
